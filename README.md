# Bookshop-System
This university project was to make an application which admin users can use to manage book stock and customer users can use to buy books. The objective of this project was to learn Object-Oriented Programming in Java. <br />
This application can be run via the jar file (given it is in the default folder with the rest of the project) as well as by importing the project and running it from a development environment/program. <br />
